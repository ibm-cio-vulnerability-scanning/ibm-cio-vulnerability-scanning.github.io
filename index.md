# OSS Vulnerability Scanning - WhiteSource setup and workflow

[<link string>](<url>)

This guide will help you understand the general workflow of this IBM organization and how to setup WhiteSource and the GitHub action to keep up to date automatically in the repository you want to contribute to.

## Requirements

- GitHub [Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
- GitHub [action installation SSH script](https://github.com/Toolbox-Mexico-CIO-Guadalajara-Public/open-source-sync-action-installer/raw/main/src/SyncActionInstaller.sh).

### 1. Forking the repository and activating WhiteSource

The GitHub organization already have WhiteSource installed in it and configured for all the respositories forked inside it.

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to and select the IBM Vulnerability Scanning organization as destination:

![How to fork](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-6294/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

3. Create a new branch called 'default_clone'. This will be the base branch that we will use to change files and create PRs as the default branch will have the GitHub action installer and the WhiteSource configuration file.

2. Activate the Issues tab:

3. A pull request will be automatically created by WhiteSource, merge the PR to the original default branch (not the 'default_clone').
